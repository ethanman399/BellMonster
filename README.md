A mod that adds a simple invisible enemy named the Bell Monster which the player must avoid.
The Bell Monster makes bell noises frequently while walking, which will change to a lower pitch and more frequent while chasing.
Players must listen out for these sounds to avoid the Bell Monster, or alternatively use the scanner at closer ranges to avoid it.
It cannot see very far and will stop chasing if the player gets a moderate distance away and cuts line of sight with it, but be aware that if it does catch you it hurts like a truck (1-2 shot).
